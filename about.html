        <h1>-GAGANDEEP KAUR</h1>
        <P>Hello Everyone. I am Gagandeep Kaur. I have completed my 12 grade education in India and pursuing 
            my two-year diploma in "Computer Programming" at Seneca. Currently I am living in Brampton, Canada 
            and working as a part-time employee at "Ocean palate Restaurant, Brampton" in the position of "Cashier". I am 
            looking to make my career in web development and for this, I will try my best.

            <br>
            <br>

            Well, I have choose the game of Badminton because I love this game. Badminton has always been one 
            of my favorite games. Whenever, I have free time, I often play badminton along with my friends. 
            In fact, sometimes in college, after lectures, if I'll get free get, I usually go to the badminton
            court to play the game. Therefore, I decided to write about this game in my final assignment.
        </P>
