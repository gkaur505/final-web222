        The game named 'Badminton' is developed in mid-nineteenth century and its roots can be traced
        to ancient Greece, China and India. It is developed by expatriate officers of British India as
        a variant of an old children's game named 'battledore and shuttlecock' and they brought it back 
        to England where it gained popularity as 'Badminton', the word derived from the Duke of Beaufort's
        Badminton House in Gloucestershire.

        <br>
        <br>

        As, it was first originated in India, it was called 'Poona' or 'Poonah' named after a city in
        western India known as 'Poona' where it was first played by the british officers. Therefore, the
        first rules for the game were set in 1873. The game was played with these rules upto 1897. In 
        1893, the Badminton Association of England (BAE) revised teh previous rules and published new
        rules and launched the sport officially with new rules at 'Dunbar' in Portsmouth on 13 September.
        The BAE also introduced All England Open Badminton championships for men's doubles, women's
        doubles, and mixed doubles singles.

        <br>

        In 1934, the International Badminton Federation (now known as the Badminton World Federation) was
        formed and it began organizing international competitions. In past few decades, China, Denmark,
        Indonesia, Malaysia, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan are the top countries which have produced
        the best badminton players. Thus, this game evolved from recreational popular professional game,
        but it is still a popular backyard sport in the United States.

    <ul>
        <li>The length of the court is 44 feet(13.4 metres) for singles and doubles</li>
        <li>The width of the court is 17 feet(5.2 metres) for singles adn 20 feet(6.1 metres) for doubles</li>
        <li>The height of the net should be 5 feet(1.5 metres)</li>
        <li>The service courts are marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service
            line at a distance of 1.98 metres from the net
        </li>
        <li>The play consists entirely of hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net into the 
            opponent's court, with the aim of making it difficult for the opponent to return the shuttlecock
        </li>
        <li>Each game is played to 21 points and players compete in best-of-three games matches</li>
        <li>The rally begins with a serve with server and receiver standing in diagonally opposite service courts</li>
        <li>If the serving side wins the rally, they will win a point and continue to serve. On the other hand, if
            the receiving side wins the rally, they win a point and become the serving side
        </li>
        <li>If the score reaches 20-20, the game continues until one side gain two point lead (such as 24-22)</li>
        <li>A fault is committed if the shuttlecock lands out of bounds, fails to clear the net, is hit by a player's
            body, or the racket does not make contact with the shuttlecock among other things
